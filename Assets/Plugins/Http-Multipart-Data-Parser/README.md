This is a pre-compiled NET standard 2.1 library, with some modifications that I am not sure if it's right or not.

The source of this library is a fork from the excellent [Http-Multipart-Data-Parser](https://github.com/Http-Multipart-Data-Parser/Http-Multipart-Data-Parser) library. The link of the fork is [here](https://github.com/dtt3212/Http-Multipart-Data-Parser/)
